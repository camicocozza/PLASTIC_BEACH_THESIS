    "- **(1)** The model is used in 1D mode (normally incident waves propagating over an alongshore uniform beach). The domain extends from $x=0$ to $x=35$m with 350 computational cells, leading to a $dx$ of 0.10 m (see [manual](https://swash.sourceforge.io/online_doc/swashuse/swashuse.html#model-description) for more details on the definition of the computational grid). Three layers are used for the vertical discretization.\n",
    "- **(2)** The bed profile is read from the text file 'bed_profile.bot'.\n",
    "- **(3)** SWASH is used in non-hydrostatic mode (important because the waves are not necessarily in shallow water), the breaking model is activated with default values, and a low friction coefficient is imposed. See [here](https://swash.sourceforge.io/online_doc/swashuse/swashuse.html#physical-parameters) for more details on the breaking model and friction.\n",
    "- **(4a)** The water level (and thus the depth at the most offshore point of our domain) is set to 0.50m. \n",
    "- **(4b)** We further prescribe a standard JONSWAP spectrum ($\\gamma = 3.3$) with $H_{m0} = 0.07$ m and $T_p=2$ s at the offshore boundary of our domain ($x$ = 0 m). The ADDBOUND command means that bound long waves are added to the irregular sea-swell waves at the offshore boundary. A weakly reflective boundary condition is imposed at the wave paddle (See also [here](https://swash.sourceforge.io/online_doc/swashuse/swashuse.html#initial-and-boundary-conditions1) for more detail on the boundary conditions). \n",
    "- **(5a)**: Definition of a single [output location](https://swash.sourceforge.io/online_doc/swashuse/swashuse.html#output-quantities-locations-and-formats) point (saved in text file 'gauge1.tbl'). The first line provides the coordinate of the output point (x=8m, y=0). The second defines the variables that are saved at this location. Outputs are saved every 0.05 seconds as of $t=0$. \n",
    "- **(5b)**: Definition of an output grid (first line) and of the variables to be saved at all grid points in the file 'grid_output.tbl' (second line). In this example the grid covers the full computational domain. Outputs are saved every 0.1 seconds starting at $t=0$.\n",
    "-  **(6)**: This command orders SWASH to start the computation. In this case, time step for the simulation is 0.025 seconds and the total run duration is 2 min (format for the time is hhmmss.xxx where hh=hours, mm=minutes, ss=seconds and xxx milliseconds). "
